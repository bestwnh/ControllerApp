# Controller Configuration
## A native macOS configuration app for 360Controller driver ðŸŽ®

This is a macOS app for configuration your controller which driver by [360Controller](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller), support macOS 10.13+

You may know the [360Controller](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller) already had a system preference plugin for configuration, so why would I make a new one?

Because I want to make a **better** one. Let's see how it get better.

## Modern UI with better support for Dark Mode
You can choose your own display mode

## Better visualization for button event

## Better visualization for stick configuration

## Now you can map only one button

Why not just [download the lastest version](https://github.com/bestwnh/ControllerApp/releases) and give it a try?

Next Step:
- [ ] ðŸ”¤Name your controller
- [ ] ðŸ—‚Highlight the button that map different
- [ ] ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³Chinese localization
- [ ] ðŸ¥šAn Easter egg

The original 3D model is from [wilsonR](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/xbox-controller-a8d4bbaecf004885bfd68fe79b0c2077).

My friend [Yue feng Jiang](https://www.artstation.com/cgwind)(a really great 3D modeler) help to make some huge improvement on the model.
